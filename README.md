# Abstract
This paper represents a classification method of retinal images to determine whether useable images or useless images using Python OpenCV. Image processing is conducted by data density procedure and optic disc extraction. Through data density procedure, we determine whether retinal vascular extracted from retinal vascular images are useful for training sets. In another hand, optic disc extraction step can determine whether images are useful or not, nevertheless data density procedure cannot extract retinal vascular. Those two steps can achieve the higher accuracy that a single step.
